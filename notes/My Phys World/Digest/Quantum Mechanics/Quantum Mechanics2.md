### How does the Geiger-Müller tube work?

[The Geiger-Müller tube | IOPSpark](https://spark.iop.org/geiger-muller-tube)
Briefly speaking, there is a *capacitor* which is surrounded by noble gas.
Then, a high potiental is applied to the capacitor.
The radiation produced particle travel through the very thin outer layer and ionise the gas particles along its way. The liberated electrons, attracted by high potiential, flee to the anode. The ionisation creates a spark and an impluse of current, which can be recorded as a count.
